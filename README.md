**Warp Engine** is a 3D game engine designed for a convenient and unlimited creation of games set in space. Its aim is to provide tools allowing a developer to make a space-set game without any boundaries nor loading times. Right now, we share with you a ready-to-use library, as well as the Warp Engine IDE (that is not really ready to use right now).
